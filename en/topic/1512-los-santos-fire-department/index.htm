INTRODUCTION\n \n\n\n\t(( The Los Santos Fire Department is one of the oldest factions on the server and is heavily influenced by the Los Angeles Fire Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\u00a0 We are also the only\u00a0faction on the server that provides fire and emergency medical services roleplay to the community.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tWe do our best to portray both the LAFD and the LACoFD, mixing aspects of both agencies into our roleplay to give the community a realistic and enjoyable experience when it comes to Fire \u0026amp; EMS roleplay.\u00a0 We incorporate several different aspects, including normal EMS \u0026amp; firefighting, technical rescue, hazardous materials, public safety diving, air operations, airport firefighting, wildland firefighting, search \u0026amp; rescue, canine, lifeguard, and maritime firefighting.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tWe hope to provide the best possible Fire \u0026amp; EMS roleplay that we can to the server and are always open to suggestions and feedback. ))\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tII. HISTORY.\n \n\n\n\tThe Los Santos Fire Department has a long history of serving the public and we are equally as dedicated today as we were on the day of our creation. The first records in the history of our department begin in the year of 1869, however, didn\u0027t become effective until 1871, when we utilized a volunteer squad of firemen organized by the current County Clerk of Los Santos under the name \u2018Engine Company No. 1\u2019. To aid us in our efforts to protect the city from fires we only carried a single fire engine along with a hose jumper. Our equipment was drawn to the scenes of fires by hand, something we tried to remedy in the spring of 1874 by asking the Los Santos City Council for horses that could pull the engine. Unfortunately, the council refused and the company disbanded.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThanks to our incredibly dedicated volunteers under the previous Engine Co. No. 1 banner, a great many of them didn\u2019t lay down their duty and instead re-organized under the new name of \u2018Thirty-Eight\u2019s Engine Company No. 1\u2019 in April of 1874. A year later a second engine company was organized in May, starting \u2018Confidence Engine Company No. 2\u2019.\n \n\n\n\tIn 1876 Los Santos acquired its first \u2018Hook and Ladder\u2019 type fire engine and placed it with the Thirty-Eight\u2019s. However, the \u2018Hook and Ladder\u2019 type engine proved far too cumbersome and ill-fitted for the city of Los Santos and was sold to a nearby town where it could provide better use. One should take note that later that year a \u2018Village Hook and Ladder\u2019 truck was purchased and formed a new company, the: \u2018Vigilance Hook \u0026amp; Ladder Co. No. 1\u2019. (Later changed to \u2018Village Hook \u0026amp; Ladder Co. No. 1\u2019) The truck was used until 1881 when a 65 ft. extension ladder was procured.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThe year 1878 a third company was formed in Los Santos which went under the name \u2018Park Hose Co. No. 1\u2019.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA fourth company was organized the year 1882 and went under the name \u2018Southern Pacific Company No. 1\u2019.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThe most eastern part of Los Santos also formed a hose company and named it \u2018East Los Santos Hose Co. No 2\u201d in the year 1883. Later that same year the last volunteering squad organized the \u2018Morris Vineyard Hose Co. No. 3\u201d.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThe following companies kept serving their duty as squads of volunteers up until February 1, 1886, when our now, still standing, paid fire department came into existence; \n\tThirty-Eight\u2019s Engine Company No. 1 \n\tConfidence Engine Company No. 2 \n\tVillage Hook \u0026amp; Ladder Co. No. 1 \n\tPark Hose Co. No. 1 \n\tSouthern Pacific Company No. 1 \n\tEast Los Santos Hose Co. No. 2 \n\tMorris Vineyard Hose Co. No. 3\n \n\n\n\t The fire department would continue to use horse-drawn carriages, which they had been utilizing since 1877, for almost fifty years and slowly phasing them out as the city allowed more resources for the department. The last horse troop to help with our firefighting was phased out on July 19, 1921. Since then the Los Santos Fire Department has done its best effort to stay up to date with technological advances in the field and strives to explore new and more efficient ways of securing the city from any unfortunate fire.\u00a0The Los Santos Fire Department was awarded a contract to provide firefighting, as well as EMS services, to the nearby city of San Fierro since 1978.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThe Los Santos Fire Department currently adheres to a strict ranking regimen that allows for the most efficient ways of handling any situations that might occur in the city, or in the nearby counties that surround. As a situation first is given notice through departmental hotlines, the most effective way of suppressing fires around the city is through the involvement of the public. When a situation has been established, the highest ranking officer on duty, who of course is available, quickly assembles a team of men and women who will rush to the scene of the incident and then will begin fire suppressing maneuvers that have been taught by our excellent training staff as well as through rigorous exercise drills. The staff is also trained in Basic Life Support, which allows for quick and immediate rescue at any given scene. A few select firefighters of highest prestige has also been trained in Advanced Life Support which means that no task is ever too big for the Los Santos Fire Department.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThe Los Santos Fire Department currently holds to the following ranking structure(from highest to lowest); \n\tFire Chief \n\tAssistant Fire Chief \n\tDeputy Fire Chief\n \n\n\n\t Battalion Chief\n \n\n\n\t Fire Captain II\n \n\n\n\tFire Captain I\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tEngineer \n\tFirefighter III \n\tFirefighter II \n\tFirefighter I\n \n\n\n\tProbationary Firefighter\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tBefore calling oneself a part of the Los Santos Fire Department, extreme and highly thorough training must be completed by each applicant. The training consists of medical exams, verbal interviews, general fitness checks, mental evaluations, as well as criminal record checks. Should any the above be under critique, the applicant will find themselves denied. This ensures that only the most qualified of personnel are employed under our Los Santos banner.\n \n\n\n\tTo succeed as a fireman an employee will need: courage, strength, and determination to serve, must be present. Should any of these qualities present themselves as below par, a review of the fireman in question will be conducted.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tFire Chiefs\n \n\n\n\t\tViola Fugate - (( @Bloodseeker ))\n\t \n\t\n\t\tJayden Hastings - (( @Frezemis\u00a0))\n\t \n\t\n\t\tRyan Lionheart - (( @Lionhearted\u00a0))\n\t \n\t\n\t\tLucas R.

<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">We do our best to portray both the LAFD and the LACoFD, mixing aspects of both agencies into our roleplay to give the community a realistic and enjoyable experience when it comes to Fire &amp; EMS roleplay.  We incorporate several different aspects, including normal EMS &amp; firefighting, technical rescue, hazardous materials, public safety diving, air operations, airport firefighting, wildland firefighting, search &amp; rescue, canine, lifeguard, and maritime firefighting.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>

<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">II. HISTORY.</span></span>
</p>
<hr /><p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The Los Santos Fire Department has a long history of serving the public and we are equally as dedicated today as we were on the day of our creation. The first records in the history of our department begin in the year of 1869, however, didn't become effective until 1871, when we utilized a volunteer squad of firemen organized by the current County Clerk of Los Santos under the name ‘Engine Company No. 1’. To aid us in our efforts to protect the city from fires we only carried a single fire engine along with a hose jumper. Our equipment was drawn to the scenes of fires by hand, something we tried to remedy in the spring of 1874 by asking the Los Santos City Council for horses that could pull the engine. Unfortunately, the council refused and the company disbanded.</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Thanks to our incredibly dedicated volunteers under the previous Engine Co. No. 1 banner, a great many of them didn’t lay down their duty and instead re-organized under the new name of ‘Thirty-Eight’s Engine Company No. 1’ in April of 1874. A year later a second engine company was organized in May, starting ‘Confidence Engine Company No. 2’.</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">In 1876 Los Santos acquired its first ‘Hook and Ladder’ type fire engine and placed it with the Thirty-Eight’s. However, the ‘Hook and Ladder’ type engine proved far too cumbersome and ill-fitted for the city of Los Santos and was sold to a nearby town where it could provide better use. One should take note that later that year a ‘Village Hook and Ladder’ truck was purchased and formed a new company, the: ‘Vigilance Hook &amp; Ladder Co. No. 1’. (Later changed to ‘Village Hook &amp; Ladder Co. No. 1’) The truck was used until 1881 when a 65 ft. extension ladder was procured.</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The year 1878 a third company was formed in Los Santos which went under the name ‘Park Hose Co. No. 1’. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">A fourth company was organized the year 1882 and went under the name ‘Southern Pacific Company No. 1’. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The most eastern part of Los Santos also formed a hose company and named it ‘East Los Santos Hose Co. No 2” in the year 1883. Later that same year the last volunteering squad organized the ‘Morris Vineyard Hose Co. No. 3”.</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The following companies kept serving their duty as squads of volunteers up until February 1, 1886, when our now, still standing, paid fire department came into existence;<br />
Thirty-Eight’s Engine Company No. 1<br />
Confidence Engine Company No. 2<br />
Village Hook &amp; Ladder Co. No. 1<br />
Park Hose Co. No. 1<br />
Southern Pacific Company No. 1<br />
East Los Santos Hose Co. No. 2<br />
Morris Vineyard Hose Co. No. 3</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<br /><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The fire department would continue to use horse-drawn carriages, which they had been utilizing since 1877, for almost fifty years and slowly phasing them out as the city allowed more resources for the department. The last horse troop to help with our firefighting was phased out on July 19, 1921. Since then the Los Santos Fire Department has done its best effort to stay up to date with technological advances in the field and strives to explore new and more efficient ways of securing the city from any unfortunate fire. </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The Los Santos Fire Department was awarded a contract to provide firefighting, as well as EMS services, to the nearby city of San Fierro since 1978. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The Los Santos Fire Department currently adheres to a strict ranking regimen that allows for the most efficient ways of handling any situations that might occur in the city, or in the nearby counties that surround. As a situation first is given notice through departmental hotlines, the most effective way of suppressing fires around the city is through the involvement of the public. When a situation has been established, the highest ranking officer on duty, who of course is available, quickly assembles a team of men and women who will rush to the scene of the incident and then will begin fire suppressing maneuvers that have been taught by our excellent training staff as well as through rigorous exercise drills. The staff is also trained in Basic Life Support, which allows for quick and immediate rescue at any given scene. A few select firefighters of highest prestige has also been trained in Advanced Life Support which means that no task is ever too big for the Los Santos Fire Department.</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">The Los Santos Fire Department currently holds to the following ranking structure(from highest to lowest);<br />
Fire Chief<br />
Assistant Fire Chief<br />
Deputy Fire Chief</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<br /><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Battalion Chief</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<br /><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Fire Captain II</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Fire Captain I</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Engineer<br />
Firefighter III<br />
Firefighter II<br />
Firefighter I</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Probationary Firefighter</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Before calling oneself a part of the Los Santos Fire Department, extreme and highly thorough training must be completed by each applicant. The training consists of medical exams, verbal interviews, general fitness checks, mental evaluations, as well as criminal record checks. Should any the above be under critique, the applicant will find themselves denied. This ensures that only the most qualified of personnel are employed under our Los Santos banner.</span></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">To succeed as a fireman an employee will need: courage, strength, and determination to serve, must be present. Should any of these qualities present themselves as below par, a review of the fireman in question will be conducted.</span></span>
